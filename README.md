# Aymane's Portfolio
Welcome to my personal digital city! This portfolio is a space where I share my journey, projects, resume, and passion for technology. It’s built to be interactive and engaging, showcasing the work I’m proud of and reflecting my personal approach to development.

You can access it at [aymanehilmi.com](https://aymanehilmi.com)

## Technical Stack
This portfolio is developed using a combination of the following technologies:
- React JS.
- Spline (for interactive 3D elements).
- TailwindCSS .

Additionally, several other libraries have been used to enhance the functionality and user experience, though I’m keeping it simple here.


## Website Still in Construction

I still work on this repos. I will continue adding new features, Easter eggs, interactive elements and at the end i will also optimize the perfs (yes actually it's shit) and make a cleaner code.
