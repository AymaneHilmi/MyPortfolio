            I'm 22 years old, and I am a software engineer based in Montpellier, France, with a strong passion for programming.
            Born in <span onClick={handleItalianClick}>Italy</span>, raised in France, of Moroccan heritage and spent a significant part
            of my life in Spain. These diverse experiences have shaped me today into a polyglot, fluent in five
            languages (Italian, French, Moroccan, English & Spanish).
            <br />
            <br />
            My journey in the world of programming began in childhood when I first encountered the website agar.io.
            It may sound trivial, but that moment sparked a fascination within me for the world of technology.
            I became captivated by the incredible things that can be created with computers and their potential for efficiency.
            While many of my classmates were still exploring their career paths, I was already certain of mine:
            I wanted to immerse myself in computer science.
            <br />
            <br />
            After earning my scientific baccalaureate with a specialization in mathematics, I chose to pursue a degree in
            computer science engineering. This allowed me to delve deeper into the inner workings of this captivating field.
            I quickly realized that programming was not just a skill but a passion, especially when it serves to enhance
            people's lives and simplify their work. I am driven by the belief that technology can empower individuals,
            streamline processes, and foster innovation.
